### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring python developer.
Learning full stack web development and automation.
I also have cool projects which involve 3d printers, raspberry Pis and other microcontrollers, ranging from making IOT vioce activated window blinds to using openCV and RPis to alert me when the neighbourhood ginger cat enters the garden.
